 conv.political.1.a:0 "At least we know who'll control the country..."
 conv.political.1.b:0 "Our Democracy is sacred!"
 conv.political.1.d:0 "The government is weak, they say. Power should be held by just one member, they shout..."
 conv.political.1.t:0 "Absolutism on the Rise"
 conv.political.10.a:0 "Spare us from this mob rule!"
 conv.political.10.b:0 "At long last, [Root.GetName] is free!"
 conv.political.10.d:0 "After their attempt at a public referendum to institute democracy was refused, the people behind the suggestion have dismissed the [Root.GetLeader] regime as incorrigible. A broad coalition of rebel groups, united by their common goal of instituting more representative political systems in [Root.GetName], have taken up arms and announced that they will not rest until the [Root.GetRulingParty] is overthrown."
 conv.political.10.t:0 "The [Root.GetAdjective] Spring"
 conv.political.11.a:0 "Pathetic, that's the right word."
 conv.political.11.d:0 "The self-styled King of [Root.GetName] is now dead and his followers forgot how to fight. The people learnt the lesson, our regime is protected by God more than those pathetic old men yelling at clouds."
 conv.political.11.t:0 "Fanatic Reactionaries defeated"
 conv.political.12.a:0 "What a bunch of quitters."
 conv.political.12.d:0 "After a few months of loud opposition against [Root.GetLeader]'s regime, calling for public elections and more liberal laws on freedom of assembly and speech, the movement seems to have fallen apart. People now express more concern about the stability of [Root.GetName] if such reforms were to take place, with those who clamor for democracy being seen more as troublemakers than everything else.\n\nMore mysteriously, many of the leading figures of the movement appear to have gone missing or stopped their work suddenly. Perhaps some of them chose to go into exile when they saw the failure of their efforts. Regardless, the [Root.GetRulingParty] government denies all knowledge and involvement."
 conv.political.12.t:0 "Democratic Movement Goes Silent"
 conv.political.13.a:0 "For the future of [Root.GetName]"
 conv.political.13.t:0 "[Root.GetLeader] Abandons Neutral Foreign Policy"
 conv.political.13_absolutist:0 "The path of monarchy is safer. Absolutism will it be."
 conv.political.2.a:0 "We can discuss this internally for a start."
 conv.political.2.b:0 "Knowing we're in the right, we can afford allowing our enemies to talk more openly."
 conv.political.2.d:0 "'If we silence the voices of the people, how can any of us claim to be the voice of [Root.GetName] ourselves? If we fear dissent, if we fear being publicly denounced or ousted by public vote, what we truly fear is that we are hated and reviled by our own citizens. Does the [Root.GetRulingParty] really have so little confidence in its principles?'\n\nA careful and loosely organized, but passionate faction in the government has begun to push for less repressive policies against enemies of the state. They want the public involved in decision-making through referendums and local party meetings, even if this means risking the future of the current agenda."
 conv.political.2.t:0 "Move Towards Democracy"
 conv.political.3.a:0 "Our only hope is that they won't organize a coup against us"
 conv.political.3.d:0 "Some may say these are just old man yelling at clouds, but the Reactionary movement is constantly gaining new supporters. What should the government do about this, however, is difficult to tell."
 conv.political.3.t:0 "Reactionary Ideas spreading throughout [Root.GetName]"
 conv.political.4.a:0 "*Sigh*, maybe we could give them that figure to avoid the destruction of [Root.GetName]?"
 conv.political.4.d:0 "Our glorious regime is being menaced by our own soldiers. They claim for a strong figure of power, chosen by God Almighty. It will only be a matter of time before they'll embrace arms publicly against [Root.GetName]."
 conv.political.4.t:0 "Absolutist Soldiers won't pledge allegiance to [Root.GetName]"
 conv.political.5.a:0 "The movement appears to grow naturally in the absence of of repression."
 conv.political.5.d:0 "Relaxing the restrictions on what sort of anti-[Root.GetRulingParty] propaganda can be spread publicly has, predictably, lead to an increase in public expressions of dissent. Organized demonstrations and pamphlets are so far found mostly in academic institutions and some of [Root.GetName]'s more unfortunate areas, but there is little doubt that the movement is spreading.\n\nThe nation's leaders are torn over the issue. [Root.GetLeader], who maintains an iron grip on party leadership, has little desire to diversify public debate. The first steps have already been taken, however, and there may be no turning back."
 conv.political.5.t:0 "Democratic Opposition Forming"
 conv.political.6.a:0 "Even if reform is happening, we must show our strength by suppressing this defiance."
 conv.political.6.b:0 "Let the people be heard."
 conv.political.6.d:0 "The demonstrations of public dissent which were once confined to limited areas are now widespread. While people gather in the streets, the [Root.GetRulingParty] finds itself at a crossroads. If we continue allowing this propaganda to spread, the referendums suggested both from within the party itself as well as the opposition may show that we do not have the support of the public. The unity we have strived for is giving way to a plurality of opinions, united against us."
 conv.political.6.t:0 "Public Call for Elections"
 conv.political.7.c:0 "At the end, a state must respect the will of its people. [Root.GetName] will hold the referendum"
 conv.political.7.d:0 "[Root.GetLeader] is only seen as a usurper by these ever-growing movements in [Root.GetName]. Soon, [Root.GetAdjective] people will revolt against the government, asking for a strong leader chosen by God Almighty. They are now demanding by us to make all humans who believe in the only God to choose whether they want the monarchy or the current regime."
 conv.political.7.t:0 "[Root.GetAdjective] Reactionaries demanding referendum"
 conv.political.8.c:0 "If we accept the referendum, perhaps we can preserve our legacy."
 conv.political.8.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, the idea of the people ruling the nation they inhabit can easily grow very popular among the people. The [Root.GetRulingParty], of course, sees the idea of democracy as represented by these movements - freedom of speech, public elections, free press - merely populist rhetoric meant to weaken [Root.GetLeader]'s government.\n\nHowever, there is no denying those ideas have taken hold among the [Root.GetAdjective] population. In true democratic fashion, they call for a public referendum on replacing the current regime. Although currently easy to ignore, these ideas have a way of growing very persistent. What will happen to us if we make peaceful revolution impossible?"
 conv.political.8.t:0 "Democrats Demand Referendum"
 conv.political.9.a:0 "Time to show these medieval protesters how modern war is done."
 conv.political.9.b:0 "In the name of God Almighty, may He choose who to lead [Root.GetName]!"
 conv.political.9.d:0 "Oh, [Root.GetLeader], the people thought you were not chosen by God and they tried to persuade you to do a referendum. But having you denied them, they preferred to do the will of God Almighty by themselves."
 conv.political.9.t:0 "For God to lead [Root.GetName]!"
